# Security

Please don't report security problems in public issues.

Report them privately through
[GitHub's vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/boxd-sh/boxd-langchain/security/advisories/new),
or email [contact@boxd.sh](mailto:contact@boxd.sh). Include what you found, how
to reproduce it, and the version of `langchain-boxd` you use. We'll confirm we
received it and keep you posted while we fix it.

## Supported versions

Fixes go into the latest release.

## Scope

This repo holds the `langchain-boxd` package, its `deepagents-code` provider
and the examples. Issues in boxd itself, such as the API or the machines, can
go to the same addresses.

## Running agents safely

A Deep Agent with this backend can run any command on its machine. That
machine is a full VM with its own kernel, so a command can't reach your own
computer, but it can reach the internet and anything the machine can. Give the
agent a machine you are happy for it to change, pass `isolated=True` to
`BoxdSandbox.create()` for code you don't trust (the machine then has no
credentials of yours), and set `delete_after` so a machine you forget about
deletes itself.
